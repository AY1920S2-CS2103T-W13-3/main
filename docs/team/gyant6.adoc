== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 3

---

== Overview

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Refactored *all commands to take in Manager objects*
** What it does: Allows developers and commands to have non-static access to Manager objects
** Justification: Previous usage of Manager object attributes were accessed using public static methods that did not align with good coding practices
** Highlights: This enhancement prevents other classes from illegal and unintended access of Manager objects. It required a good understanding of what every command was doing and being able to change static variables to non-static ones.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added a show command that allows the user to display further details of course-related information in MODdy
** Added the ability to store course information in JSON format that can be used by all users of MODdy
