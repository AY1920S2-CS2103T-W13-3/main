== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a profile).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Dependency between Personals and Modules
(Insert class diagrams showing dependencies)

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== New Profile Feature

=== Add Module / Deadline Feature

The `add` command adds the entity (module, deadline) with the fields provided by the user. `add m/module_code y/semester_index` adds a module and `add m/module_code y/semester_index t/task d/deadline` adds a deadline.

==== Current Implementations

`AddCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `AddCommand` is parsed using `AddCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following high-level sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the `Ui`, `Logic` & `Model` components when a module is being added.

(diagram)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add` mechanism behaves at each step:

. User launches the application.
.. If it is the first time, a `Profile` object will be created using `NewCommand`.
. User enters the command. `AddCommandParser` will create a `AddCommand` object, which can contain `moduleCode`, `semesterIndex`, `grade`, `task`, `deadline`.
. `AddCommand#execute(Model model) is executed. `Profile#getHashmap()#values()` is called to check if the module already exists.
.. If module exists, user will be prompted to add a task and deadline.
.. If module does not exists, a `Personal` object will be created.
. After the module is added, a `CommandResult` containing the log of execution result will be returned.

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: How `add` executes

=== Show Feature

The `show` feature allows the user to display information about a `Module`, `Course`, `Focus Area` or `Semester` with the command `show`, appended with the tags. These information cannot be seen from the main UI and have to be displayed through the `show` command.

The tags are:

* `m/module_code` for `Module`
* `c/course_name` for `Course`
* `f/focus_area` for `Focus Area`
* `y/semester_index` for `Semester`

==== Current Implementations

`show` command is parsed using `ShowCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `show` operation works with input: `show c/Computer Science`

image::ShowCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Have one ShowCommand for all objects
** Pros: Repeated code is avoided
** Cons: Takes in an Object in its constructor, any Object can call this method and cause the application to fail

* *Alternative 2:* Have a separate ShowCommand (e.g. ShowModuleCommand, ShowCourseCommand) for each object shown
** Pros: Applies Single Level of Abstraction Principle (SLAP)
** Cons: Too many classes having repeated code

Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 due to the benefits of avoiding repeated code. To tackle the cons from this, we implemented methods to gracefully reject other Objects that unintendedly called this method.

=== Edit Profile / Module Feature

The `edit` feature supports editing of `Profile` with the command `edit`, and editing of `Module` with the command `edit` appended with `m/module_code`.

==== Current Implementations

`edit` command is parsed using `EditCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

To edit `profile`, the command `edit` should be appended with one or more of the tags `n/name`, `c/course`, `cs/current_semester`.

To edit `module`, the command `edit` should be appended with `m/module`, followed by one or more of the tags `s/semester` and  `g/grade`.

`edit` command extends command class and uses inheritance to facilitate implementation. Hence it inherits the following methods:

- `Command#execute(Model model)`

The following sequence diagram shows how the `edit` command works: `edit m/CS2105 g/A`:

==== Design Considerations

=== Delete Profile / Module / Deadline Feature

The delete profile feature is a complementary feature to the new profile feature. It enables the removal of a profile from a `ProfileList`. This also deletes all modules and their deadlines under the `Profile`. This `delete` feature can be used by appending the command with the tag `n/name`

In addition, the delete module feature is a complementary feature to the add module feature. It enables the removal of a `Module` from the list of modules the user is taking in his `Profile`. As a consequence, all deadlines stored under the module will be deleted. This `delete` feature can be used by appending the command with the tag `m/module_code`.

Lastly, the delete deadline feature is a complementary feature to the add deadline feature. It enables the removal of a `Deadline` of a particular `Module`. This `delete` feature can be used by appending the command with the tags `m/module_code` and `t/deadline`.

==== Current Implementations

`DeleteCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `DeleteCommand` is parsed using `DeleteCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between `Ui`, `Logic` and `Model` components when a module is deleted.
