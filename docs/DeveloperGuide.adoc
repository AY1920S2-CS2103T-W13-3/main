== Introduction

Welcome to *MODdy's Developer Guide*! This document is to help you understand the implementation of MODdy and its features better.

[TIP]
Feel free to open an issue in our link:{repoURL}/issues[issue tracker] if you have any questions, features suggestion or bugs to report.

== Setting up
This is a guide on how to set up MODdy as a project on your computer.

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
This section describes some noteworthy details on how different components in MODdy work together.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The high-level _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/John`.

.Component interactions for `delete n/John` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts namely `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ProfileListPanel`, `DeadlineListPanel`,
 `CoursePanel`, `FocusAreaPanel`, `IndividualModulePanel`, `OverviewPanel`, `ModuleListPanel`, `WelcomeView`, `HelpWindow` and `StatusBarFooter`.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The following panels are made up of one or more parts. For example,

* `ProfileListPanel` consists of `ProfileCard`,
* `DeadlinePanel` consists of `DeadlineCard`,
* `OverviewPanel` consists of `ProfileCard` and `OverviewModuleCard`,
* `ModuleListPanel` consists of `ModuleCard`,
* `FocusAreaPanel` consists of `ModuleCard`,
* `CoursePanel` consists of `CourseFocusAreaCard` and `CourseRequirementCard`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a profile).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the profile data.
* stores the semester-module data in a HashMap.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Deadline>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The Storage component consists of the following three main parts:

. Profiles: `JsonProfileListStorage` handles reading and saving of profiles from json to `Profile` objects and vice versa. The `Profile` objects are stored in a `ProfileList`.
. Modules: `JsonModuleListStorage` handles only reading of modules from json to `Module` objects, which are stored in a `ModuleList`.
. Courses: `JsonCourseListStorage` handles only reading of courses from json to `Course` objects, which are stored in a `CourseList`.

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Profile List data in json format and read it back as a `ProfileList` object.
* can read Module List data from json format to a `ModuleList` object.
* can read Course List data from json format to a `CourseList` object.
// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Dependency between Personals and Modules
(Insert class diagrams showing dependencies)

=== New Profile Feature
The `new` feature allows the user to create a profile with the command `new`, appended with the tags.

The tags are:

* `n/name` for `Name`
* `c/course` for `Course`
* `cs/current_semester` for `Current Semester`
* `s/focusArea` for `Specialisation`

==== Current Implementations

`NewCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `NewCommand` is parsed using `NewCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `new` operation works with the input: `new n/John c/Computer Science y/2.2`

image::NewCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1:* Have an additional tag `cs/currentYear.currentSemester` to identify the year and semester user is in
** Pros: Easier to differentiate the year and semester user is in among all `y/year.semester` tags
** Cons: More tags to parse, and also less intuitive for user (have to use both `cs/` and `y/`)

* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* Use the `y/year.semester` tag like all other commands
** Pros: More intuitive for user (only one tag related to year and semester)
** Cons: Harder to convey the idea that it has to be *current* year and *current* semester to user

Eventually, we decided on alternative 2 to prioritize user-friendliness and cleaner code.

=== Add Module / Task Feature

The `add` feature allows the user to add a module and a task with a deadline for an existing module with the command `add`, appended with the tags.

The tags are:

* `m/module_code y/year.semester` for adding a module
* `m/module_code y/year.semester t/task d/deadline` for adding a task to an existing module

[NOTE]
You can add multiple modules at once but only to the same year and semester, e.g. `add m/CS1231 m/IS1103 m/MA1521 y/1.1`

==== Current Implementations

`AddCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `AddCommand` is parsed using `AddCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` operation works with input: `add m/CS2105 y/2.2`

image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

Aspect 1: How modules are added

* *Alternative 1:* Delete only one `Module` object with one `add` command
** Pros: Easier to implement and consistent across all commands
** Cons: More to type if user intends to delete multiple `Module` objects

* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* Delete multiple `Module` objects with one `add` command
** Pros: More convenient for the user
** Cons: Inconsistent with adding a task, which can only take in one task at a time

Eventually, we decided on alternative 2 for the convenience of the user since the number of modules taken per semester is not low.

Aspect 2: How `deadline` feature is implemented

* *Alternative 1:* Both `date` and `time` is compulsory for a `deadline`
** Pros: Easier to implement since both date and time will be parsed
** Cons: Some tasks do not have a timing that it must be completed by, making it user-unfriendly

* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* The `date` is compulsory while `time` is optional for a `deadline`
** Pros: Gives user the flexibility to input different types of tasks
** Cons: More bugs in `deadline` related method calls

Eventually, we decided on alternative 2 for the benefits of the user. To tackle the cons, we have set `time` to be "23:59" by default if user did not specify.


=== Show Feature

The `show` feature allows the user to display information about a `Module`, `Course`, `Focus Area` or `Semester` with the command `show`, appended with the tags. These information cannot be seen from the main UI and have to be displayed through the `show` command.

The tags are:

* `m/module_code` for `Module`
* `c/course_name` for `Course`
* `f/focus_area` for `Focus Area`
* `y/semester_index` for `Semester`

==== Current Implementations

`ShowCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `ShowCommand` is parsed using `ShowCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `show` operation works with input: `show c/Computer Science`

.Activity Diagram for a Show Command input
image::ShowCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

NOTE: If more than accepted tag is given, such as `show c/Computer Science m/CS1101s`, MODdy will not display anything and will show the user a message that only one tag should be provided.


==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Have one ShowCommand for all objects
** Pros: Repeated code is avoided
** Cons: Takes in an Object in its constructor, any Object can call this method and cause the application to fail

* *Alternative 2:* Have a separate ShowCommand (e.g. ShowModuleCommand, ShowCourseCommand) for each object shown
** Pros: Applies Single Level of Abstraction Principle (SLAP)
** Cons: Too many classes having repeated code

Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 due to the benefits of avoiding repeated code. To tackle the cons from this, we implemented methods to gracefully reject other Objects that unintendedly called this method.


=== Edit Profile / Module Feature

The `edit` feature supports the editing of both `Profile` and `Module`. `Profile` is edited with the command `edit` and `Module` is edited with the command `edit` appended with `m/module_code`. +

The edit profile feature is a complementary feature to the new profile feature. It allows the user to edit their profile that was created at the start. Profile features such as name, course, current semester and focus area can be edited using this command. +

In addition, the edit module feature is a complementary feature to the add module feature. It allows the user to edit a module that has previously been added. The user can edit module information such as the semester it is taken and grade. +

Lastly, the edit deadline feature is a complementary feature to the add deadline feature. It allows the user to edit a deadline that has previously been added to a module. The user can edit deadline information such as it's description, date and time. +

==== Current Implementations
`EditCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `EditCommannd` is parsed using `EditCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

To edit `profile`, the command `edit` should be appended with one or more of the tags:

- `n/NAME` : New name
- `c/COURSE` : New course
- `y/CURRENT_SEMESTER` : New current semester
- `f/FOCUS_AREA` : New focus area

To edit `module`, the command `edit` should be appended with `m/MODULE`, followed by one or more of the tags:

- `s/SEMESTER` : New semester where module is taken
- `g/GRADE` : New grade for the module
- `t/TASK` : Old task description
- `nt/NEW_TASK` : New task description
- `d/DEADLINE` : New date and time

To edit a deadline, append `edit m/MODULE` with `t/TASK` that already exists and is to be edited, followed by either `nt/NEW_TASK` and/or `d/DEADLINE` which contain the new task or deadline that will replace the existing one.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `edit` command works: `edit n/John`:

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit n/John` Command
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

- By requiring a `m/MODULE` field for the user to edit `Module`, it clearly shows the intent of the user, and whether the `Profile` or a `Module` should be edited.

// tag::delete[]
=== Delete Profile / Module / Deadline / Grade Feature

The delete profile feature is a complementary feature to the new profile feature. It enables the removal of a profile from a `ProfileList`. This also deletes all modules and their deadlines under the `Profile`. This `delete` feature can be used by appending the command with the tag `n/name`

In addition, the delete module feature is a complementary feature to the add module feature. It enables the removal of a `Module` from the list of modules the user is taking in his `Profile`. As a consequence, all deadlines stored under the module will be deleted. This `delete` feature can be used by appending the command with the tag `m/module_code`.

Next, the delete deadline feature is a complementary feature to the add deadline feature. It enables the removal of a `Deadline` of a particular `Module`. This `delete` feature can be used by appending the command with the tags `m/module_code` and `t/deadline`.

Lastly, the delete grade feature enables the removal of a `Grade` from a particular `Module`. This `delete` feature can be used by appending the command with the tags `m/module_code` and `g/` without any grade.

==== Current Implementations

`DeleteCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `DeleteCommand` is parsed using `DeleteCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows the interactions between `Ui`, `Logic` and `Model` components when a task is deleted.

.Interactions between `Ui`, `Logic` and `Model` components for the `delete m/CS2101 t/work` command.
image::DeleteDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Delete only one `Module` or `Deadline` object with one delete command
** Pros: Easier to implement and consistent across all inputs
** Cons: More to type if user intends to delete multiple `Module` objects or `Deadline` objects

* *Alternative 2:* Delete multiple `Module` or `Deadline` objects with one delete command
** Pros: More convenient for the user
** Cons: Inconsistent with deleting a profile, which can only take in at most one profile

Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 due to the benefits of consistency in the number of items to be deleted, as well as to reduce the number of bugs faced.
// end::delete[]

=== Help Feature
The `help` feature allows the user to view the pop-up help window with the command `help`. This feature allows the user to have a
quick view of sample inputs if they run into trouble while using the application.

==== Current Implementations

`HelpCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Effort

In this section, we highlight the amount of effort took for us to develop MODdy, the challenges faced in this development and our eventual achievement.

=== Overall effort

Estimated effort: 16

The above estimated effort uses Address Book 3 (AB3) as a base estimation of 10 for effort taken.

In short, AB3 essentially stores data related to multiple persons. MODdy does that for one, but does much more. MODdy is able to store data for a user such as their course, focus areas and personal information of their modules, be it in the past, present or future.

There was a considerable amount of time spent throughout the construction of MODdy. We had to figure out how different courses and modules could be linked to each other in MODdy. We also had to plan out features that could allow users to make this course and module management application more personal. Features were not just implemented immediately, but significant considerations were taken to decide whether it was consistent with the other features that MODdy offered.

Feature implementation was also not just a single point of discussion. New features required edits to other features to maintain consistency, while some required even newer features to complement it. All these discussions were held at least once a week for a minimum of 2 hours each round to ensure that we were in sync with each others' work.

However, we also understand that AB3 has certain code classes that are complicated to build and these classes were also reused in MODdy. Examples of these reused classes are found in the `commons` package, while MODdy-specific classes such as `JsonSerializableCourseList`, `JsonCourseListStorage` and `JsonCourse` were implemented with heavy reference to original AB3 classes. Hence, the estimated effort was scaled back slightly.

=== Challenges faced

Ultimately, the biggest challenge was getting the User Interface (UI) of MODdy to be exactly as we envisioned. This UI was new and completely different from the existing AB3 UI, and this meant that we had to write entirely new code in an area which we were unfamiliar with. As a group of relatively inexperienced programmers, our prior application-building experiences were mostly limited to command-line interface applications. As such, implementing MODdy without any points of reference posed a huge challenge.

Another challenge was having to overcome issues and bugs that our new features brought. Manual testing took a significant amount of time, ensuring positive tests worked as they should, while we also had to design extensive negative tests to cover as many situations of undesired input as we could.

=== Achievements

MODdy turned out to be the best version of the MODdy that we had planned for in the first place. Initially, we scaled back on the number of features due to the difficulties faced during implementation, for fear of a lack of time. However, we were able to scale back up our efforts after overcoming difficulties and bugs faced, to bring back the initially planned features.

We are satisfied with the latest release version of MODdy as it is able to perform what we wanted it to do in the first place, to be a one-stop application for personal course and module management in NUS.
