== Introduction

MODdy is an one-stop application for all your academic needs, keeping you organized and well-planned throughout your course of study.
It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Currently, MODdy targets student from *School of Computing (SoC)* in the National University of Singapore (NUS).
If you are from SoC and is looking for an application to manage all your modules throughout your degree progression, jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started.
Enjoy!

== Quick Start (coming in v2.0)

//.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
//.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
//.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
