== Features
The following 10 sections provides you a deeper understanding on how to use the features you can perform in *MODdy* and how the features work.

====
*Command Format*

* Alphabets preceding the `/` sign are the prefix tags you need to provide.
* Words succeeding the `/` sign are the parameters supplied by you, e.g. in `add m/moduleCode`, `moduleCode` is a parameter which can be used as `add m/CS2103`.
* Parameters can be entered in any format and are case-insensitive, unless stated otherwise.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `m/moduleCode [g/grade]` can be used as `m/CS2103 g/A+` or as `m/CS2103`.
====


[[Help]]
=== Viewing help : `help`

If you are unsure about the commands and want to seek help, this command opens up a help window where there are examples for basic command format.
For more detailed help, you can visit the link provided, as shown in the figure below. The link directs you to this User Guide where you can get more information on how to use each feature in *MODdy*. +

Format: `help`

[[New]]
=== Creating new user profile : `new`

If you want to get started on using MODdy, you will have to create a new profile. By using this command, it creates a profile for you as shown in the figure below. You will have to provide your details as parameters.

Format: `new n/name c/course y/year.semester [f/focusArea]`

****
* `c/course` and `f/focusArea` is case-insensitive but has to be its *full name*. If you are unsure of what is allowed, you can refer to the <<Appendix, Appendix>> for the list of courses and focus areas supported by MODdy.
* If you have yet to decide on a focus area, you can choose to add it to your profile later using the <<Edit, edit>> feature mentioned in <<Edit, Section 4.4>>. Other profile fields can be changed using the <<Edit, edit>> feature as well.
* `y/year.semester` must be entered as an integer. You should only enter the year and semester that you are *currently* in. If you are now a year 2 semester 1 student, enter `y/2.1`.
* You can only have one profile! If you wish to create a new profile, you can remove it with the <<Delete, delete>> feature mentioned in <<Delete, Section 4.6>>.

****

TIP: `new n/John c/Computer Science y/2.2` +
Creates a new profile with the name "John", currently majoring in "Computer Science" and is a year 2 semester 2 student.




[[Add]]
=== Adding module or task: `add`

If you want to add modules to each of your semesters or add tasks to each of your modules in the current semester, this command is the right one for you!

There are *two* ways you can use the `add` command: +

==== Adding a module to *MODdy* +
Format: `add m/moduleCode y/year.semester [g/grade]` +

TIP: You can add multiple modules at the same time but only to the *same* year and semester. +
To add multiple modules, just append the `m/moduleCode` tags right after another, e.g. `add m/CS1231 m/IS1130 m/MA1521 y/1.1`.

NOTE: However, you cannot add grades when adding multiple modules.

****
* `y/year.semester` must be entered as an integer. You should enter the year and semester that you *took the module* in. If you took the module in year 2 semester 1, enter `y/2.1`.
* As you have already specified the current semester you are currently in when creating your profile, *MODdy* will indicate modules added to prior semesters, current semester and future semesters as *"COMPLETED"*, *"IN_PROGRESS"* and *"PLANNING"* respectively.
* `g/GRADE` is optional. If you have yet to obtain a grade for the module, don't worry, you can always add it to the module later using the <<Edit, edit>> feature mentioned in <<Edit, Section 4.4>>.
****

TIP: `add m/CS2105 y/2.1 g/A+` +
Adds CS2105 to the list of modules under year 2 semester 1 with the resulting grade, A+

****
*Checking of Prerequisites* +
If you have not met the prerequisites of a module, you will receive a warning message as shown in the figure below. You can ignore the message if you have already taken the preclusion of that prerequisite module.
****

==== Adding a task with a deadline to a module in *MODdy* +
Format: `add m/moduleCode t/task [d/deadline]` +

TIP: You can add multiple tasks at once but only to the *same module*, e.g. `add m/CS1231 t/tutorial d/2020-04-20 18:00 t/assignment d/2020-04-25 23:59`. +

NOTE: However, for multiple tasks, as long as one task has a deadline, all `t/task` tags have to be appended with `d/deadline` tags. +
For the tasks with no deadlines, the tag can just be `d/`, e.g. `add m/IS1103 t/project d/2020-05-01 23:59 t/reflection d/`.

****
* You can only add a task to the module if the module has been added to a semester in *MODdy* previously.
* `d/deadline` must be entered in the format `d/YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`, e.g. `d/2020-03-31 23:59`.
* `d/deadline` is optional if you are only adding one task and your task has no deadline. If your task has a `Date` due but no `Time` due, just enter `d/YYYY-MM-DD` and we will set the `Time` to default (23:59).
* You can delete a completed task using the <<Delete, `delete`>> feature mentioned in <<Delete, Section 4.6>>.
****
